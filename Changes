0.018   2021-04-22  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: high

	- [bugfix] installed_versions is only an array of version numbers,
	  not a hash of arch => versions.


0.017   2021-04-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- [bugfix] Didn't access the correct data structure element.


0.016   2020-10-08  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	[Bug fixes]

        - Fix installing executable. When downloaded software is an executable
	  instead of an archive, the install process is different and not
	  compatible with that of an archive. A directory in install dir should
	  be created instead of direct symlink to the executable in download
	  dir.

        [Enhancements]

	- Add subcommands list, is-installed-any, is-installed-latest,
          is-downloaded-any, is-downloaded-latest.


0.015   2020-10-02  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Support installing executable in addition to archive.

	- Adjust to Software::Catalog 1.0.7 and App::swcat 0.015.


0.014   2019-10-26  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: high

	- Adjust to Software::Catalog 1.0.6 (incompatible change, renamed
	  methods).

        [REMOVED FEATURES]

        - Remove make_latest_dir_as_symlink option, instead check
	  dedicated_profile setting from the software catalog module.


0.013   2019-10-15  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- list-downloaded: Add --arch (previously private argument _arch) and
          --per-arch options.

        - cleanup-download-dir: Perform cleanup on a per-arch basis, as it
          should. Example, if firefox has these versions downloaded: 69.0
          (win64), 69.0.1 (linux-x86_64), 69.0.2 (linux-x86_64), then we should
          only remove 69.0.1 (older Linux version) and not 69.0 because 69.0 for
          win64 is the newest.
